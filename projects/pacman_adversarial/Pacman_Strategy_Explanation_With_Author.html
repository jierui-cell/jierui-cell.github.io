    <h1>Multi-Agent Adversarial Pacman Project</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This mini-contest involves a multi-player capture-the-flag variant of Pacman, where agents control both Pacman and ghosts in coordinated team-based strategies. Each team will try to eat the food on the far side of the map, while defending the food on their home side. </p>
    <p>Each team's agents are in the form of ghosts on their home side and Pacmen on the opponentâ€™s side. Also, team is now able to eat their opponent when the agent is a ghost. If a Pacman is eaten by a ghost before reaching his own side of the board, he will explode into a cloud of food dots that will be deposited back onto the board.</p>
    <p>THe ultimate goal is to reach as much points as possible while keep the other team's points as low as possible. <strong>Eventually, the team with highest points win the game.</strong></p>
    <h2>Score Calculation</h2>
    <p>The score in this Pac-Man strategy is calculated based on a linear combination of features and their corresponding weights. The primary goal is to maximize the score by considering both offensive and defensive strategies.</p>
    <h3>Evaluation Function</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The <code>evaluate</code> function computes the score for each action by combining various features with their respective weights.</li>
        <li>Formula: <code>score = features * weights</code></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Features and Weights</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Different features are considered for scoring, including the number of remaining food pellets, distance to food, presence of invaders, and proximity to defenders.</li>
        <li>Example of offensive weights:
            <pre><code>{'successorScore': 100, 'defense': 0, 'numInvaders': 0, 'distInvader': 0, 'nearDefender': -30, 'distFood': -1, 'carryingRisk': -5, 'distCapsule': -3, 'trap': 1, 'stop': -10, 'reverse': 0}</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Example of defensive weights:
            <pre><code>{'successorScore': 0, 'defense': 100, 'numInvaders': -1000, 'distInvader': -10, 'nearDefender': 0, 'distFood': 0, 'carryingRisk': 0, 'distCapsule': 0, 'trap': 0, 'stop': -100, 'reverse': -2}</code></pre>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Detailed Explanation of Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>successorScore:</strong> Measures the score of the game state after making a move. Higher scores indicate better states.</li>
        <li><strong>defense:</strong> Indicates whether the agent is playing a defensive role. A value of 1 means the agent is defending, while 0 means it is not.</li>
        <li><strong>numInvaders:</strong> Counts the number of enemy agents in the territory. Higher values indicate more invaders.</li>
        <li><strong>distInvader:</strong> Measures the distance to the nearest enemy invader. Smaller distances are better for defense.</li>
        <li><strong>nearDefender:</strong> Measures the proximity to enemy defenders. Smaller distances indicate closer defenders, which is risky for the agent.</li>
        <li><strong>distFood:</strong> Measures the distance to the nearest food pellet. Smaller distances are better for collecting food.</li>
        <li><strong>carryingRisk:</strong> Evaluates the risk based on the amount of food the agent is carrying and the distance to a safe zone. Higher values indicate greater risk.</li>
        <li><strong>distCapsule:</strong> Measures the distance to the nearest power capsule. Smaller distances are better for collecting capsules.</li>
        <li><strong>trap:</strong> Penalizes the agent if it is near a trap (surrounded by walls). A value of -1000 indicates a high penalty.</li>
        <li><strong>stop:</strong> Penalizes the agent for stopping its movement. A value of 1 means the agent stopped, and it is penalized for it.</li>
        <li><strong>reverse:</strong> Penalizes the agent for reversing its direction. A value of 1 means the agent reversed, and it is penalized for it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Strategy Implementation</h2>
    <p>The author implements a hybrid strategy that switches between offensive and defensive roles based on the game state:</p>
    <h3>Offensive Strategy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The agent seeks food and capsules to increase its score.</li>
        <li>It evaluates the distance to the nearest food and capsules and avoids defenders by using features like <code>distFood</code>, <code>distCapsule</code>, and <code>nearDefender</code>.</li>
        <li>It considers the risk of being captured when carrying food (<code>carryingRisk</code>).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Defensive Strategy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When invaders are detected, the agent switches to defense.</li>
        <li>It evaluates features like <code>numInvaders</code> and <code>distInvader</code> to focus on repelling enemy agents.</li>
        <li>It prioritizes returning to a safe position if carrying food or if the number of food pellets is low.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Differences Between Offensive and Defensive Agents</h2>
    <h3>Offensive Agent</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Focuses on collecting food and capsules.</li>
        <li>Uses features that help it navigate towards food while avoiding defenders.</li>
        <li>Penalizes actions like stopping or moving in the reverse direction, which could make it easier for defenders to catch it.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Defensive Agent</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Focuses on preventing enemy agents from scoring.</li>
        <li>Uses features that help it locate and chase invaders.</li>
        <li>Penalizes stopping and reversing to ensure it stays proactive in defending the territory.</li>
        <li>Prioritizes actions that bring it closer to invaders and blocks them from reaching the food.</li>
    </ul>
